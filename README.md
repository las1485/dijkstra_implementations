# dijkstra_implementations
Dijkstra implementations in different data structures

This project is part of the Master degree program of computer science of PUC-Rio.

Diskstra was implemented in different data structures and, their complexty time, calculated.

Data structures:
- Binary min heap
- Array
- Finabocci heap
